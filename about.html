      <p> The key is to understand the human behaviour and how it reacts or interact with the environment.
        Computer interface provides technology which analyses human and computer interaction.
        Facial emotions convey the intention of a person. The emotion communicates the state of the person such as joy,
        sadness, anger, etc. The human communication has one-third part of verbal communication and two third part of
        nonverbal communication. Moreover, the facial expressions are an important means of interpersonal communication.
        Therefore, the facial expression is a key means for the detection of emotions.
        The non-verbal interaction among humans is through facial expression. The reason behind this interaction is that humans
        can identify the emotion in an efficient and prompt manner. Thus, there exists a demand to develop a machine,
        which can recognize the human emotion.
